# ATM-Transaction-System-using-Java

ATM Transaction System deals with the account
transactions of the customers. An automated teller
machine (ATM) is an electronic banking outlet that
allows customers to complete basic transactions without
the aid of a branch representative or teller. Now-a-days,
everyone has a bank account and ATM can be used to
withdraw, deposit money into savings and current
account.

This program helps us to deposit, withdraw and
display money of a customer provided the customer enters
correct account number and ATM pin. This program is
written in Java language using Java features like Classes,
Methods, Instances, Inheritances, Exceptions, Access
specifiers etc... This program is useful for the customers
and the bank because it increases readability, increases
durability, decreases complexity, increases security
regarding the transactions.
